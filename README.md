#♻️ CarbonSight AI: CSRD Report Generator ⚡ AI-Powered Sustainability Reporting Made Simple

🌍 Overview

CarbonSight AI is a physics + AI powered tool that helps companies generate CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) audit-ready reports for their energy systems.

It combines:

✅ Physics-based modeling (compressed air system efficiency, energy savings potential)

✅ AI-powered CSRD compliance reports (aligned with ESRS standards)

✅ Actionable recommendations for energy optimization & carbon reduction

This project is designed as an MVP but scalable towards a $1B sustainability SaaS platform.

⚙️ Features

📊 Input plant data (flow rate, pressure, power, efficiency)

🔬 Run physics model → calculate theoretical vs actual power use

🧮 Gap Analysis → identify efficiency gap & savings opportunity

🤖 AI Report Generation → GPT-4.1-mini generates CSRD/ESRS audit-ready reports

📥 Downloadable reports in Markdown / PDF
